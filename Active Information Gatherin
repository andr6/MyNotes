Active Information Gathering:
============================
to find ip:
	arp-scan --local
	netdiscover -i <interface>
Network Scanning:
	nmap:
		For Boxes:
			1. nmap -p- --min-port 10000 ip => gives list of open ports
			2. nmap -p port1,port2---- -sCV -oA nmap_all_ports ip
			3. nmap -sUCV -oA nmap_UDP ip
		options:
			-6 => if we use ipv6 ip
			-p- => all ports
			-F => scan for common 100 ports(fast scan)
			-A => it means ALL
			--top-ports=x
			-sS => stealth/SYN scan
			-sC => default scripts
			-sV => enumerate versions
			-sU => udp scan
			-sT => tcp scan
			-T => timing
				-T4 => stable network
				-T5 => aggressive
				-T2 => low bandwidth network
			-oA outputfile => all suported file formats
		NSE:(/usr/share/nmap/scripts)
			nmap --script-help <scriptname> => get help about any script
			nmap <ip> --script=scriptname
			important scripts:
				--script=safe => tells nmap to only run scripts if it seems safe against the target
				--script=vuln
				--script=exploit
		firewall:
			how to know if FIREWALL is present => "ALL PORTS ARE FILTERED"
			Use -T0/-T1/-T2
			-sS => stealth/SYN scan
			-Pn => do not ping
			-f => -f is for fragmenting. Does not work with -sT and -sV
			-D RND:10 => -D is for decoy. Does not work with -sT and -sV
			--mtu x => mtu(Maximum Transmission Unit) size of packet sent by nmap, x IS ALWAYS A MULTIPLE OF 16.
			--script firewall-bypass
			NOTE:: if nothing works in firewall, try UDP scan
		NOTE:after nmap scans, search the service name and version on google to see if its vulnerable.
	masscan:(large networks)
		apt install masscan
		masscan -p80-8000 --rate=150000 -e tan0 --router-ip gateway_ip -oL output.txt
			-p => ports
			--rate => defines packets-per-second
				careful: make sure target can support this amount of traffic
			-oL => list output
			-e interface
Important Ports:
	ftp(21):
		kali => apt-get install ftp
		anonymous login:
			ftp ip
				Username => anonymous
				Password => anonymous
		bruteforcing:
			hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/ncrack/default.usr -P <> ftp://192.168.102.143
		ftp-commands:
			ftp ip
			>username:
			>password:
			>get "filename" => to download a file 
			>put "filename" => to upload a file 
		exploitation:
			1.read juicy files
			2.ftp has access to folder where site is hosted => upload shell
			3.ftp is a clear text protocol, so we can get a .pcap file in CTF having credentials for FTP protocol
	SSH(22):
		ssh user@ip => password bases ssh login
		Key-Based SSH:(aka rsa_key authenciation)
			2 Keys => a public and a private key
				When the two match up, the system unlocks without the need for a password.
				Public key:
					it is left on server
				Private key:
					it is with us/owner
					You can increase security even more by protecting the private key with a passphrase.
				generating key:(id_rsa)
					we may need to generate our own keys in ctf.
					ssh-keygen -t rsa
						it will give me two files
							id_rsa => private key, we can apply passphrase too.
								/home/.ssh/id_rsa
							id_rsa.pub => public key
								/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
								This public key is later stored on server
					chmod 600 key_name
				exploitation:
					We basically have "private key"
					if this key has passphrase:
						ssh2john key.ssh > ssh.hash
						john ssh.hash --wordlist=a.txt =>  it will proivde passphrase
					chmod 600 key_name
					ssh -i id_rsa <user>@ip
				Usage of tool "ssh-keygen":
					ssh-keygen -t rsa -f my_key
					-t => type of algorithm
					-f => name of key
						default name => id_rsa
		shellshock vulnerability: Covered in seperate sheet
	TELNET(23):
		telnet ip
		bruteforcing:(never happened)
			hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt telnet://<ip> -t 4
	DNS(53):
		ports:
			53 => TCP
			53 => UDP
		Basics:
			translates domain names into IP. 
			Its divided into several 'zones' and top level is called 'root zone'
			Terms:
				TLD: top-level domain => com/net/org/gov
				Domain: google.com
				Subdomain: adwords.google.com
				Host: www.google.com
				Zone file: its a text file that contains the relations between domain names and IP addresses. it resides in  'authorative NS' and it lists resources available by a domain.
			It hosts two zones for each domain:
				Forward lookup zone:
					Its used to find the IP address of a specific hostname
				Reverse lookup zone:
					Its used to find the hostname of a specific IP address
			working:
				hostname in browser -> computer DNS -> external DNS(DNS recursor) -> one of the servers in the DNS root zone -> root server gives name of the server responsible for the zone containing TLD -> DNS recursor asks that zone server for authoritative nameserver -> authoritative nameserver is the final step and it contains the DNS records in a local database called 'ZONE file'
			Types of records:
				A Record:(host record)
					it contains the ipv4 of a host.
				PTR Record:(Pointer Records)
					it is used in reverse lookup zone and is used to find the records associated with an IP address.
				NS Record:(NameServer Records)
					it contain the name of authoritative servers hosting DNS records for a domain
				MX Record:(MailExchange Records)
					it contains name of the servers responsible for handling email for domain. A domain can have multiple MX records
				TXT record:
					it can contain any arbitrary data and can be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification
				SOA Record:
					it shows the following stuff:
						The primary NS
						The responsible party for the domain (admin.website.com).
						A timestamp that changes whenever domain updates.
						The number of seconds before the zone should be refreshed.
						The number of seconds before a failed refresh should be retried.
		when we see DNS on a machine/ctf, we use it to perform zone transfer to find additional domains
		Zone Transfer:(First we try zone transfer)
			A zone transfer is a database replication in which the zone file is copied from a master server to a slave server. Zone transfers should only be allowed to authorized slave DNS servers but many are misconfigured so, anyone asking for a copy of zone file will usually receive one.
			it only works on DNS-TCP
				dig @ip -t axfr domain_name
				dig axfr domain_name @ip
		When Zone Transfer fails:
			DNS bruteforce:
				nmap --script=dns-brute <domain> --script-args=dns-brute.hostlist=/opt/dnsrecon/namelist.txt
			Reverse DNS scan:(PTR)
				msfconsole:
					use auxiliary/gather/enum-dns
					set domain <domain>
					set ENUM_RVL true
					set IPRANGE ip/24
					run
		Resolving domain name in AD:
			nslookup:	
				nslookup
				>server ip
				>127.0.0.1
				>127.0.0.2
				>ip
			dig:
				dig @ip gussed_domain_name.local
		dig:
			dig abcd.com => prints A record (gives ip)
			options:
				-t MX
				-t NS
				-t ANY
	finger:(79)
		SOLARIS
		it can used to enumerate what users are currently logged in
		used in: Sunday(HTB)
		./finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t <ip>
			users.txt => seclists
		msf> use auxilary/scanner/finger/finger-users
	Kerberos:(88)
		TCP/UDP => 88
		See Active Directory sheet
	RPCBIND(111):(aka Portmapper)
		it is used to share network drives
		How to access it:
			via 111 TCP/UDP
			via 32771 in Oracle Solaris
		Enumeration:
			nmap -p 111 --script=rpcinfo ip => it will run script related to rpc
			rpcinfo: 
				What services are running?
				Rpcinfo -p <target ip>
			rpcbind:(tool)
				rpcbind -p <ip> => list all services running on port 111
	MSRPC(135/139/445/593):Covered in Active Directory Sheet
	SMB/Netbios(137/138/139/445):(Server Message Block)
		NBT => netbios over TCP
		How to access it?	
			Via TCP port 139 => Netbios(Network Basic Input Output System)
			Via TCP port 445 => raw SMB over TCP, aka Microsoft-DS		
		Basics:
			SMB is the modern dialect of Common Internet File System (CIFS)
			It’s used for sharing resources like files on both windows/linux.
		Enumeration:	
			smbclient:(used for downloading/uploading files)
				list shares:
					smbclient -L ip => anonymous login
					smbclient -L ip -u "" => anonymous login
					smbclient -L //ip/
					smbclient -L <ip> -U 'user_name%password' => authenciated login
					Note:
						//ip/ = ////ip// = ip
				list files in a share:
					smbclient //ip/sharename
				commands:
					smb> put nc.exe
					smb> get revshell.php
			smbmap:(show shares along with permissions)
				smbmap -H ip => show shares along with permissions
				smbmap -u anonymous -H ip  => anonymous login
				smbmap -u user -p pass ip -R sharename => see files
				smbmap -u user -p pass ip -R sharename -A file => get "file"
				smbmap -u user -p pass/hash -H ip -d domain
			confusion over smbmap and smbclient:
				use smbmap to see share permissions
				use smbclient to see files in a share
			we can also mount shares instead of using smbclient:
				mount //ip/sharename /mnt/abcd => for linux//10/10
				mount -t cifs //ip/sharename /mnt/abcd => for windows
					cifs => windows protcol for mounts
	SNMP(161):(Simple Network Management Protocol)(udp)
		Basics:
			manages network devices on a network
			Components:
				A. Managed Device:
					A device having SNMP service enabled.
				B. NMS(Network Management System):
					A software system used to monitor network devices. 
				C. Agent:
					A software that runs on a MANAGED DEVICE. Its primary job is to convert information to SNMP compatible format for the management of network using SNMP protocol. It has access to a database known as MIB(management information base). MIB is a virtual database organized like a tree where branches represent different organizations and leaves correspond to specific variable values that can then be accessed by an external user.
			we have "community strings" in a snmp system.
				PUBLIC(Read Only)
				RIVATE(Read Write)
				MANAGER
		Enumeration:
			nmap -sU -p 161 ip
				Note: normal nmap scan will not point out 'snmp' as it operates on an UDP port
			onesixtyone -c /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp_onesixtyone.txt <ip> => find communities
			snmpwalk -c <community string> -t 10 -v<version_number> ip 
				if output is "NO RESPONSE" => that given community is NOT SUPPORTED
				it will give an OID number
			snmpwalk -c public -v<version> ip OID_number => enumerate users
		Community Bruteforcing:
			auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_login		
			hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community-strings.txt target.com snmp
	LDAP(389/636/3268/3269):(lightweight directory access protocol)

		636 => ldaps (secure)
		3268 => Global Catalog(LDAP in AD)
		3269 => Global Catalog Secure(LDAPS in AD)
		stores information such as usernames, which can help in password cracking attacks
		Cli-based Enumeration:
			ldapsearch:
				ldapsearch -h ip => if we have creds
				ldapsearch -h ip -x => no creds req, it gives us domain
				Authenciated bind enumeration:
					ldapsearch -x -h ip -D 'domain\user' -w 'pass' -b " "
					error:
						bind must be completed => incorrect creds
				Unauthenciated bind enumeration:
					ldapsearch -x -h ip -D 'domain\user' -b " "
				Extracting info:
					-b "CN=Users,DC=,DC=" => users
					CN=computers

	MS-SQL:(1433)
		dbeaver:(gui)
			apt-get install dbeaver
		mssqlclient.py:(cli)
			Part of impacket-toolkit
			Aside from being able to interact with the SQL server, it provides not one, but two ways to execute system commands:
				xp_cmdshell:
					Its an optional feature of MS-SQL servers that allows to spawn a system shell and execute commands. It is disabled by default, but you may find it enabled on older versions of MS-SQL. Or if you have a high-privilege user, you can enable the xp_cmdshell and then use it to run commands.
					We can use Impacket’s mssqlclient.py tool to connect to and interact with MS-SQL servers and use the xp_cmdshell Commands are executed with the privileges of the SQL service account.
						SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell
						SQL> disable_xp_cmdshell
						SQL> xp_cmdshell SOMECOMMAND
				sp_start_job:
					sp_start_job command can be used to start SQL jobs, but it can also be abused to execute system commands. It’s important to note that this feature results in blind command execution, i.e. you don’t get any output back, so it’s important to build your commands and one-liners correctly. Commands are executed with the privileges of the SQL service account.
						SQL> sp_start_job SOMECOMMAND
			Usage:		
				mssqlclient.py username@ip
					it provides sql shell for MS-SQL
					sometimes it dont work, then use "-windows-auth" flag
	oracleDB(1521):
		basics:
			in it, the users have SID. 1st we need to gather SID, then using that SID, we bruuteforce their creds (name:pass)
			default_creds => scott:tiger

				note: use ; at the end of each line
	RDP(3389):(Remote Desktop Protocol)
		rdesktop ip -g 1900x600
			sometimes, it causes issues, in that case use another tool
		xfreerdp /v:ip:port /u:username /p:password
			options:
				/u:username or domain/user or user@domain
	WinRM(5985/5986):(Windows Remote Management)
		aka Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0
		How to access it:	
			By default WinRM HTTP uses port 80. On Windows 7 and higher, the default port is 5985.
			By default WinRM HTTPS uses port 443. On Windows 7 and higher, the default port is 5986.
		it is used for Powershell-Remoting
		Evil-WinRM:
			Installation
				gem install evil-winrm
			evil-winrm -u user -p 'pass' -i ip
			evil-winrm -u user -H lm_hash -i ip
			Commands:
				menu => show commands
				Invoke-binary some_binary_in_kali.exe
				Bypass-4MSI => bypasses AMSI
					AMSI blocks binary execution
			File Transfers:
				upload local_filename destination_filename => upload file to victim
					local files can be auto-completed using tab key. It is not needed to put a remote_path if the local file is in the same directory from which evil-winrm is invoked.
				download remote_filename destination_filename => download from victim to us
					 it is not needed to set local_path if the remote file is in the current directory.
